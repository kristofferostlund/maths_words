###A small project in which text will be analyzed.

This small project was written for an assignment in maths at univerity. It can be found [right here](http://words.kristofferostlund.com/) and was quite a lot of fun to make. 

Its written in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) using mostly vanilla JavaScript, [D3.js](http://d3js.org/), and a whole lot of trial and error.
